# HST-Identifier

This is a machine learning project that identifies High-Speed Trains (HSTs) based on their country of origin using image classification. It is built using Fastai, PyTorch, and Gradio.

Users can upload or drag-and-drop an image of a high-speed train, and the model will predict which country it is from (e.g., Japan, China, France).
